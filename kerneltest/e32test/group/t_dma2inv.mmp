// Description: Creates a copy of T_DMA2 which uses 'inverted' (from the more
// common case) thread priorities. With DMA_INVERTED_THREAD_PRIORITIES defined
// the priority of the DMA test client threads will be higher than that of the
// corresponding channel DFC queue threads. This test case can help uncover
// wrong assumptions about relative thread priorities in DMA PIL & PSL code,
// both in uni-core and SMP implementations.
