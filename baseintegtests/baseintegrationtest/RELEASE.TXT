RELEASE.TXT
===========

Summary of Contents
====================
This document describes the components in the Base Integration Test area. This
area contains test code which is distinct and separate from the E32 and F32
test suites which are generally used in Base testing. Please note that tests
will typically use the Test Execute Framework test harness and so will have
dependencies outside the code provided by a Base Porting Kit.

The following test suites are currently in place:

a) Fat32 Test Suite
	Location: \src\cedar\generic\base_integration_test\testsuites\fat32
	Documentation: \src\cedar\generic\base_integration_test\testsuites\fat32\documentation

b) SD Test Suite
	Location: \src\cedar\generic\base_integration_test\testsuites\sd
	Documentation: \src\cedar\generic\base_integration_test\testsuites\sd\documentation

Build Instructions
===================
 
All test suites in this area can be built from the following location: 

\src\cedar\generic\base_integration_test\group

using standard build commands such as:

bldmake bldfiles
abld test build armv5

etc.

Known Issues
==============

In the FAT32 test suite, tests associated with the testcase PBASE-FSINFOSTRUC-1-0289 are known to fail.
This occurs as the FAT32 FSInfo Sector is not fully implemented as yet. 

In the SD test suite, tests associated with the testcase PBASE-SDTESTSPECFS2-0203
and PBASE-SDTESTSPECFAT32FSBACKUPSECTORS-0216 are know to fail. This due to the
Backup Boot Sectors not being supported as yet.

Technical Help
===============

Technical queries regarding this test code should be addressed to the Base
group within Symbian, in particular the Test Technical Lead (TTL) for Base.
